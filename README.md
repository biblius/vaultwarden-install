# Vaultwarden Install

This document provides scripts that can be utilised to easily set up a [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden)
instance with sqlite directly on a `aarch64 (ARMv8)` machine (without docker) using a self signed certificate for TLS.

Additionally, it provides a guide that can be followed step by step for building and deploying a Vaultwarden instance.
The guide assumes you already have an ready Pi you can connect to and assumes you are using linux on the main machine.
Parts of it are taken from [this guide](https://gist.github.com/avoidik/9f12ef4feae6ccf7a5801a520931c5d1) for which I am forever grateful.

We will primarily focus on the `aarch64` architecture, but the same principles apply for any. Do note that if you are compiling for different architectures
the scripts will not work, however they can be modified to suit your needs.

## Scripts

Tested on Linux Ubuntu 22.04 for the main machine and Orange Pi Zero2 and Zero3 as the remotes.

1. [Compiling the binary](#compiling-the-binary)
   
   On your main machine, run the following script. It performs all steps listed in the section.
   ```bash
    bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biblius/vaultwarden-install/master/vw-compile.sh) 
    ```
   
2. Transfer the binary
   
   Not a script, but ensure you have the generated binary on the remote by copying it to wherever you want (this examples copies to root home)
   ```bash
   scp vaultwarden/target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/vaultwarden root@<PIE_IP>:
   ```

3. [Deploy Vaultwarden](#infrastructure)

   On your remote, run the following script. It performs all steps listed in the section and prompts you for some params.
   Change the `/path/to/binary` to wherever the vaultwarden server binary is located.
   ```bash
   bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biblius/vaultwarden-install/master/vw-install.sh) /path/to/binary
   ```

4. Uninstall Vaultwarden

   On your remote, run the following script. It will purge all files and user configuration from the device created by the second script. mkcert and argon will
   have to be removed manually.
   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biblius/vaultwarden-install/master/vw-purge.sh | bash
   ```

## Guide

### Compiling the binary

We'll be compiling the binary on our main machine, for which we will need [rust. ðŸ¦€](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Since we are focusing on `aarch64`, we have to add it to `rustup`'s target list as well as make sure we have
the necessary compilation plumbing for it.

The first command adds the target, the second one installs dependencies needed to cross compile

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
```

After this, there should be a new directory at `/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu`. This directory contains the necessary libraries
for the target architecture and we have to tell cargo to use it. We do this by pasting the following in `~/.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = "aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc"
rustflags = [
    "-L/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu",
    "-Ctarget-feature=+crt-static",
]
```

This makes sure the compiler will use the new directory as the [sysroot](https://autotools.info/pkgconfig/cross-compiling.html) during compilation - it is the equivalent of setting `PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu` when running `cargo build`.
Additionally, we are linking everything statically, which ensures the binary does not need any dependencies when it's run on the target system.

We have the plumbing set up, time to clone

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dani-garcia/vaultwarden.git
cd vaultwarden
```

Now we have to cross our fingers and run

```bash
cargo build -F sqlite -F vendored_openssl --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --release
```

This builds the binary with sqlite as the database backend (adjust it accordingly) and more importantly uses the vendored feature of OpenSSL which
makes sure it is statically compiled. The compilation might take a few minutes.

If all we see is green messages and then a "finished", it means we have successfully built vaultwarden! It's smooth sailing from here.
All that's left to do on the main machine for now is to transfer the binary to the remote (pie)

```bash
scp vaultwarden/target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/vaultwarden root@<PIE_IP>:
```

### Infrastructure

Time to switch to the pie.

We assume we are root.

#### Create files

Create necessary directories

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/vaultwarden/bin
mkdir /opt/vaultwarden/data
```

Download and unpack web vault (check latest available version [here](https://github.com/dani-garcia/bw_web_builds/releases))

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/dani-garcia/bw_web_builds/releases/download/v2023.12.0/bw_web_v2023.12.0.tar.gz
tar -zxf bw_web_v2023.12.0.tar.gz -C /opt/vaultwarden/
rm -f bw_web_v2023.12.0.tar.gz
```

Create `/opt/vaultwarden/.env` (see more options [here](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/blob/main/.env.template) or in the admin panel)

```.env
DATA_FOLDER=/opt/vaultwarden/data/
DATABASE_MAX_CONNS=10
WEB_VAULT_FOLDER=/opt/vaultwarden/web-vault/
WEB_VAULT_ENABLED=true
ROCKET_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
ROCKET_PORT=6060
WEBSOCKET_ENABLED=true
WEBSOCKET_ADDRESS=<PIE_IP>
WEBSOCKET_PORT=3012
DOMAIN=https://<PIE_IP>:6060
```

Create a secure admin token with argon2 and append it to the `.env` file

```bash
echo -n "MySecretPassword" | argon2 "$(openssl rand -base64 32)" -e -id -k 65540 -t 3 -p 4r >> /opt/vaultwarden/.env
```

#### Enable TLS

Download and install mkcert, a simple utility for making CAs and certs.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases/download/v1.4.3/mkcert-v1.4.3-linux-arm -o /usr/local/bin/mkcert
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mkcert
mkcert -install
update-ca-certificates
```

Create the directory and certificates

```bash
mkdir /opt/vaultwarden/cert
mkcert -cert-file /opt/vaultwarden/cert/rocket.pem -key-file /opt/vaultwarden/cert/rocket-key.pem <PIE_IP> <PIE_IP>
```

Verify the cert

```bash
openssl verify -verbose -CAfile /root/.local/share/mkcert/rootCA.pem /opt/vaultwarden/cert/rocket.pem
```

Add the cert and key to `.env`

```bash
echo "ROCKET_TLS={certs="'"'"/opt/vaultwarden/cert/rocket.pem"'"'",key="'"'"/opt/vaultwarden/cert/rocket-key.pem"'"'"}" >> /opt/vaultwarden/.env
```

#### Add user, group, and systemd service

Add the user and group

```bash
addgroup --system vaultwarden
adduser --system --home /opt/vaultwarden --shell /usr/sbin/nologin --no-create-home --gecos 'vaultwarden' --ingroup vaultwarden --disabled-login --disabled-password vaultwarden
```

Assign the necessary permissions

```bash
chown -R vaultwarden:vaultwarden /opt/vaultwarden/
chmod +x /opt/vaultwarden/bin/vaultwarden
```

Create a systemd service in `/etc/systemd/system/vaultwarden.service`

```service
[Unit]
Description=Vaultwarden Server
Documentation=https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden
After=network.target

[Service]
User=vaultwarden
Group=vaultwarden
EnvironmentFile=-/opt/vaultwarden/.env
ExecStart=/opt/vaultwarden/bin/vaultwarden
LimitNOFILE=65535
LimitNPROC=4096
PrivateTmp=true
PrivateDevices=true
ProtectHome=true
ProtectSystem=strict
DevicePolicy=closed
ProtectControlGroups=yes
ProtectKernelModules=yes
ProtectKernelTunables=yes
RestrictNamespaces=yes
RestrictRealtime=yes
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes
LockPersonality=yes
WorkingDirectory=/opt/vaultwarden
ReadWriteDirectories=/opt/vaultwarden/data
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable systemd service

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable vaultwarden.service
systemctl start vaultwarden.service
systemctl status vaultwarden.service
```

If it failed, check with

```bash
journalctl -xeu vaultwarden.service
```

If the rocket has launched we're good to go! Head on over to `<PIE_IP>:<VW_PORT>/admin`.

### Clients and CA

To make clients trust the certificate we just generated, they need to trust the local CA created by mkcert.
On your pie, you can execute

```bash
ls /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
```

and then cat the certificate.

On your main machine create a `/usr/share/ca-certificates/mkcert_pie.crt` file with the contents of the certificate, then run `sudo update-ca-certificates`. You might also manually have to add the certificate in certain browsers.

On mobile devices, follow instructions on how to configure trusted CAs for your device. This [link](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2844832?hl=en) could help you out for android.
